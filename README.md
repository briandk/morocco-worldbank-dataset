## Overview

This repository contains an R project, including code and analysis, for an exploratory look at a dataset from the World Bank.

## About the Data

From the World Bank's [website for the data][1]:

> This dataset contains raw response data to a nano-survey that was conducted in Morocco on the right to access to information and the right to petition and motion the government. A nano-survey is an innovative technology that extends a brief survey to a random sampling of internet users. Note: "NA" or "N/A" indicates "No Answer." Sub-national location data is available for 2/3 of survey recipients. 54,441 random internet users in Morocco were exposed to a portion of this survey, with 15,020 respondents providing at least partial responses.

## About the Analysis Code

I conducted this analysis in [R][2], using `packrat` to manage and version any non-base packages to ease reproducibility.
